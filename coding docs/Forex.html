                <p>
                    I recommend choosing only one pair / metal / index, in only one session (London and New York are the best choices</p>

                <p>
                    You should master the chosen pair by backtesting it (I highly recommend to use
                    <a href="https//:www.tradingview.com ">
                        <b>TradingViewpro</b></a>
                    plan, so you can replay price on any timeframe). Start by going back a few weeks on the chart, and backtest every single chosen session.</p>

                <p>
                    This will help you to understand the theories and logic behind everything the chosen pair does (in the chosen session of course!!!)</p>

                <p>
                    Trading on 4-5 or even more pairs will confuse you using this strategy. Personally, I only trade <b>EUR/USD</b> in NewYork session, from 2pm to 5pm (GMT+2 timezone, Hungary), meaning I'm actively trading 3 hours/day. I started to trade
                    forex for financial and time freedom. Why would I trade 8-10 hours a day then? Trust me, EVERY session has more than enough opportunities EVERY SINGLE DAY!</p>

                    <b>Broker choice</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do some research, and use that broker who can satisfy your needs</li>
                        <li>offers the lowest spreads</li>
                        <li>pay you out without a question</li>
                        <li>Personally I use ICmarkets, shoutout to them</li>
                    </ul> <br>

                    <b> News</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Before every session open, you should go and check out if there's any upcoming<strong>HIGH IMPACT NEWS</strong></li>
                        <li>I recommend <a href="https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar ">
Forex Factory calendar</a>for this purpose.</li>
                        <li>Trading news is risky. In order to protect your capital you should ALWAYS be careful opening a trade before high impacts (marked with <i color="red ">red</i> folder on Fx Factory)</li>
                        <li>If you've got an open position before the news are released, you should manage it to risk free (put your stoploss to at least BreakEven [BE] )</li>
